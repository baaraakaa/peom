Was there a touch of spring? 
Did she have a pink dress on? 
And when she smiled, her shyest smile 
Could you almost touch the warmth? 
And was it your first love, a very precious time?

Was there the faintest breeze? 
And did she have a ponytail? 
And could she make you feel ten feet tall, 
Walking down the grassy trail? 
Was it your first love, a very precious time, time?


Now they got me trying to define, in later life 
What her love means to me 
And it keeps me struggling to remember, my first touch of spring.


Was there a touch of spring, in the air? 
And did she have a pink dress on? 
And when she smiled, her shyest smile 
Could you almost touch the warmth? 
Was it your first love, 
A very precious, very precious, very precious time, time.

__TITLE__ Angel Dust  __TEXT__
He was groovin' 
and that was when he coulda sworn 
the room was movin' 
But that was only in his mind 
He was sailin' 
he never really seemed to notice 
vision failin' 
'cause that was all part of the high 
Sweat was pourin' -  
he couldn't take it 
The room was exploding -  
he might not make it. 
Angel Dust/Please, children would you listen. 
Angel Dust/Just ain't where it's at. 
Angel Dust/You won't remember what you're 
missin', but down some dead end streets 
there ain't no turnin' back.

They were standin' 
ev'rybody in a circle; 
the whole family 
listening to the preacher's words 
Sis was cryin' 
She alone held all the secrets 
'bout his dyin' 
tears fallin' to earth 
Maybe her fault 
He was so trusting 
God only knew why 
they was dustin'! 
Angel Dust/Please children would you listen. 
Angel Dust/Just ain't where it's at. 
Angel Dust/You won't remember what you're

__TITLE__ Grandma's Hands  __TEXT__
Grandma's hands clapped to church on Sunday mornings 
Grandma's hands played the tambourine so well 
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning 
She say, 'Scotty why you run so fast, 
Might fall on a piece of glass, 
Might be snakes there in that grass?' 
Grandma's hands, they keep on calling to me.

Grandma's hands soothed the local unwed mothers 
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell 
Grandma's hands, lord they'd really come in handy 
She say, 'Bobbie why you want to whip that boy? 
What you want to whip him for? 
He didn't throw no apple core.' 
Grandma's hands, they keep on calling to me.


Grandma's hands soothed the local unwed mothers 
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell 
Grandma's hands, well they really came in handy 
She say, 'Bobbie why you want to whip that boy? 
What you want to whip him for? 
He didn't throw no apple core.' 
But I don't have grandma anymore 
When I get to heaven I'll look for grandma's hands. __END__ 
__TITLE__ I Think I'll Call It Morning  __TEXT__
I'm gonna take myself a piece of sunshine 
and paint it all over my sky. 
Be no rain. Be no rain. 
I'm gonna take the song from every bird 
and make them sing it just for me. 
Be no rain. 
And I think I'll call it morning from now on. 
Why should I survive on sadness 
convince myself I've got to be alone? 
Why should I subscribe to this world's 
        madness 
knowing that I've got to live on?

I think I'll call it morning from now on. 
I'm gonna take myself a piece of sunshine 
and paint it all over my sky. 
Be no rain. Be no rain. 
I'm gonna take the song from every bird 
and make them sing it just for me. 
Why should I hang my head? 
Why should I let tears fall from my eyes 
when I've seen everything that there is to see 
and I know that there ain't no sense in crying! 
        I know that there ain't no sense in crying! 
I think I'll call it morning from now on. __END__ 
__TITLE__ Johannesburg  __TEXT__
What's the word? 
Tell me brother, have you heard 
from Johannesburg? 
What's the word? 
Sister/woman have you heard 
from Johannesburg? 
They tell me that our brothers over there 
are defyin' the Man 
We don't know for sure because the news we 
get is unreliable, man 
Well I hate it when the blood starts flowin' 
but I'm glad to see resistance growin' 
Somebody tell me what's the word? 
Tell me brother, have you heard 
from Johannesburg? 
They tell me that our brothers over there 
refuse to work in the mines, 
They may not get the news but they need to know 
we're on their side. 
Now sometimes distance brings 
misunderstanding, 
but deep in my heart I'm demanding; 
Somebody tell me what's the word? 
Sister/woman have you heard 
'bout Johannesburg? 
I know that their strugglin' over there 
ain't gonna free me, 
but we all need to be strugglin' 
if we're gonna be free 
Don't you wanna be free? __END__ 
__TITLE__ The Bottle  __TEXT__
See that black boy over there, runnin' scared 
his ol' man's in a bottle. 
He done quit his 9 to 5 to drink full time 
so now he's livin' in the bottle. 
See that Black boy over there, runnin' scared 
his ol' man got a problem 
Pawned off damn near everything, his ol' 
woman's weddin' ring for a bottle. 
And don't you think it's a crime 
when time after time, people in the bottle.

See that sista, sho wuz fine before she 
started drinkin' wine 
from the bottle. 
Said her ol' man committed a crime 
and he's doin' time, 
so now she's in the bottle. 
She's out there on the avenue, all by herself 
sho' needs help from the bottle. 
Preacherman tried to help her out, 
she cussed him out and hit him in the head with a bottle. 
And don't you think it's a crime 
when time after time, people in the bottle.


See that gent in the wrinkled suit 
he done damn near blown his cool 
to the bottle 
He wuz a doctor helpin' young girls along 
if they wuzn't too far gone to have problems. 
But defenders of the dollar eagle 
Said 'What you doin', Doc, it ain't legal,' 
and now he's in the bottle. 
Now we watch him everyday tryin' to 
chase the pigeons away 
from the bottle. 
And don't you think it's a crime 
when time after time, people in the bottle. __END__ 
__TITLE__ The Klan  __TEXT__
Countryside was cold and still 
There were three crosses on the hill 
Each one wore a burning hood 
To hide its rotten core of wood 
And I say father, father I hear an iron sound 
Hoof beats on the frozen ground 
And downhill the riders came 
Lord it was a cryin' shame 
To see the blood upon their whips 
To hear the snarlin' from their lips 
And I cried mother, mother I feel a stabbing pain 
Blood runs down like summers rain 
And each one wore a mask of white 
To hide his cruel face from sight 
And each one sucked a hungry breath 
Out of the empty lungs of death 
And I say sister, sister, I need you to take my hand 
It's always lonely when it's time to stand 
He who rides with the klan 
Is a devil and not a man 
For underneath his white disguise 
I have looked into his eyes 
And I say brother, brother, stand by me 
It's not so easy to be free 
Father, mother, sister, brother, stand by me 
It's not so easy to be free 
It's not so easy to be free 
It's not so easy to be free 
Nobody ever said it would be easy 
Nobody ever said it would be easy 
It's not so easy, no it's not so easy __END__ 
__TITLE__ The Revolution Will Not Be Televised  __TEXT__
You will not be able to stay home, brother. 
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out. 
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip, 
Skip out for beer during commercials, 
Because the revolution will not be televised.

The revolution will not be televised. 
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox 
In 4 parts without commercial interruptions. 
The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon 
blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John 
Mitchell, General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat 
hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary. 
The revolution will not be televised.


The revolution will not be brought to you by the 
Schaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie 
Woods and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia. 
The revolution will not give your mouth sex appeal. 
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs. 
The revolution will not make you look five pounds 
thinner, because the revolution will not be televised, Brother.


There will be no pictures of you and Willie May 
pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run, 
or trying to slide that color television into a stolen ambulance. 
NBC will not be able predict the winner at 8:32 
or report from 29 districts. 
The revolution will not be televised.


There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down 
brothers in the instant replay. 
There will be no pictures of pigs shooting down 
brothers in the instant replay. 
There will be no pictures of Whitney Young being 
run out of Harlem on a rail with a brand new process. 
There will be no slow motion or still life of Roy 
Wilkens strolling through Watts in a Red, Black and 
Green liberation jumpsuit that he had been saving 
For just the proper occasion.


Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Hooterville 
Junction will no longer be so damned relevant, and 
women will not care if Dick finally gets down with 
Jane on Search for Tomorrow because Black people 
will be in the street looking for a brighter day. 
The revolution will not be televised.


There will be no highlights on the eleven o'clock 
news and no pictures of hairy armed women 
liberationists and Jackie Onassis blowing her nose. 
The theme song will not be written by Jim Webb, 
Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom 
Jones, Johnny Cash, Englebert Humperdink, or the Rare Earth. 
The revolution will not be televised.


The revolution will not be right back after a message 
About a white tornado, white lightning, or white people. 
You will not have to worry about a dove in your 
bedroom, a tiger in your tank, or the giant in your toilet bowl. 
The revolution will not go better with Coke. 
The revolution will not fight the germs that may cause bad breath. 
The revolution WILL put you in the driver's seat.


The revolution will not be televised, will not be televised, 
will not be televised, will not be televised. 
The revolution will be no re-run brothers; 
The revolution will be live. __END__

A rat done bit my sister Nell. 
   (with Whitey on the moon) 
Her face and arms began to swell. 
   (and Whitey's on the moon) 
I can't pay no doctor bill. 
   (but Whitey's on the moon) 
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still. 
   (while Whitey's on the moon) 
The man jus' upped my rent las' night. 
   ('cause Whitey's on the moon) 
No hot water, no toilets, no lights. 
   (but Whitey's on the moon) 
I wonder why he's uppi' me? 
   ('cause Whitey's on the moon?) 
I wuz already payin' 'im fifty a week. 
   (with Whitey on the moon) 
Taxes takin' my whole damn check, 
Junkies makin' me a nervous wreck, 
The price of food is goin' up, 
An' as if all that shit wuzn't enough: 
A rat done bit my sister Nell. 
   (with Whitey on the moon) 
Her face an' arm began to swell. 
   (but Whitey's on the moon) 
Was all that money I made las' year 
   (for Whitey on the moon?) 
How come there ain't no money here? 
(Hmm! Whitey's on the moon) 
Y'know I jus' 'bout had my fill 
   (of Whitey on the moon) 
I think I'll sen' these doctor bills,

__TITLE__ Winter In America  __TEXT__
From the Indians who welcomed the pilgrims 
And to the buffalo who once ruled the plains 
Like the vultures circling beneath the dark clouds 
Looking for the rain 
Looking for the rain

Just like the cities staggered on the coastline 
Living in a nation that just can't stand much more 
Like the forest buried beneath the highway 
Never had a chance to grow 
Never had a chance to grow


And now it's winter 
Winter in America 
Yes and all of the healers have been killed 
Or sent away, yeah 
But the people know, the people know 
It's winter 
Winter in America 
And ain't nobody fighting 
'Cause nobody knows what to say 
Save your soul, Lord knows 
From Winter in America


The Constitution 
A noble piece of paper 
With free society 
Struggled but it died in vain 
And now Democracy is ragtime on the corner 
Hoping for some rain 
Looks like it's hoping 
Hoping for some rain


And I see the robins 
Perched in barren treetops 
Watching last-ditch racists marching across the floor 
But just like the peace sign that vanished in our dreams 
Never had a chance to grow 
Never had a chance to grow


And now it's winter 
It's winter in America 
And all of the healers have been killed 
Or been betrayed 
Yeah, but the people know, people know 
It's winter, Lord knows 
It's winter in America 
And ain't nobody fighting 
Cause nobody knows what to save 
Save your souls 
From Winter in America


And now it's winter 
Winter in America 
And all of the healers done been killed or sent away 
Yeah, and the people know, people know 
It's winter 
Winter in America 
And ain't nobody fighting 
Cause nobody knows what to save 
And ain't nobody fighting 
Cause nobody knows, nobody knows 
And ain't nobody fighting 
Cause nobody knows what to save __END__
